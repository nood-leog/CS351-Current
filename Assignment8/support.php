                    <h2>My guitar is broken. Can you fix it?</h2>
                    <div>

                    <h2>Do temperature and humidity affect my instrument? </h2>
                    <div> 
                        Unless it's made of graphite, environmental factors definitely make a difference. Depending on where you live, the severity of the effects varies. Extremes of temperature or humidity, as well as drastic shifts between extremes, will take more of a toll and require more frequent setups.
                    </div>

                    <h2>How can I prolong the life of my instrument?</h2>
                    <div> 
                        It's all about maintenance. From rehearsal to gig night, the world is a dangerous place and no guitar is safe. If you want your instrument alive and kicking for years to come, regular setups and professional repairs are a must.
