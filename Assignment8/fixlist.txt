There was no requirement to create the classes for anything in this project, nor should there be any

Folder structure was not changed for the assignment

index.php should retrieve all data from the $_POST and $_GET arrays

index.php should make all calls to model functions

product_list.php should not contain control or calls to any model files

there should be no calls to any model function in aside.php

header.php, horizontal_nav_bar.php, aside.php, and footer.php should be included in files like shipping.php, support.php, and product_list.php, not in index.php

!DONE All .js files should be included at the bottom of the html, right before the closing body tag
!DONE All under construction pages should be removed
!DONE There should only be one <!DOCTYPE html> on any html page. The header, nav bar, aside, and footer  should not contain <!DOCTYPE html>, as these are all combined into one .html file
!DONE On support.php, the accordion covers up the Contact Us drop down
!DONE In product_list.php, the links for add, edit, and delete product should not be referencing a view file
!DONE With the exception of ./index.php files, all other index.php files should redirect to ./index.php
